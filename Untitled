Patrik Laine wasnt sure what to expect from his first taste of the Stanley Cup playoffs.
The Winnipeg Jets sniper was eager to get the experience under his belt and he did more than that, supplying the game-tying goal at 4:51 of the third period, setting the stage for his team to walk away with a 3-2 victory over the Minnesota Wild on Wednesday night at Bell MTS Place.
The goal was vintage Laine.
After Jets centre Paul Stastny made a smart play to delay at the blue line after Wild defenceman Matt Dumba stepped up to hit him before dropping the pass for Laine, who walked into the slot and ripped a shot over the glove of Devan Dubnyk.
I saw that Parise was trying to block (Dubnyks) blocker side and I just tried to shoot past his leg and I think I hit a pretty good spot, said Laine. It was hard to catch.
It turns out it was impossible to catch.
Laines goal helped turn the tide for the Jets, who gave up a pair of goals early in the third period to fall behind after taking a 1-0 lead.
The marker came 53 seconds after Zach Parise gave the Wild a 2-1 advantage.
That was not the start for the third period that we wanted. I think its not going to affect our game even though we are going to be down at some point, thats going to happen in the playoffs. Its just the way we can bounce back and get a tying goal and then right after that, get the game-winning goal. It tells us a lot about this team, how special this team is and how good we are.
Laine was one of eight Jets players to make his playoff debut and he was able to soak in the atmosphere of his first whiteout.
It was a lot of fun. It was pretty unreal to skate on the (playoff) ice for the first time, said Laine. Its hard to describe what kind of feeling it was, but it was just incredible.
A goal is always a goal. But the atmosphere is just â€“ the place exploded.
